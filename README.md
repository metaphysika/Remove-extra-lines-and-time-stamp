# Remove extra lines and time stamp

This little script is used to remove extra spaces between lines of text and also remove time stamps in the format of 00:00.

This is helpful for reformatting text from AI based transcript services that include extra spacing and time-stamps.

I have deployed the code with a hot key triggered workflow in Alfred.
